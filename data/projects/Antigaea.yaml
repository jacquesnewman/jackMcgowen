description: "Antigaea is a fantastical 2D co-op game of survival. Set on a mystical island in the sky, 
the players have started a chain reaction which causes neighboring islands to crash into the mainland. 
Use a variety of magic traps and projectile weapons to defeat hordes of golem-like creatures, who arrive
 with every colliding landmass. Strategic placement of traps, coordinated fire, and some luck will be 
 needed to survive all the waves and win the game!"
